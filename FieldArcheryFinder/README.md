# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Lynn Ellingworth

## Overview.
My hobby is field archery. When I first started out I found that it was quite difficult to find some shoot grounds, particularly those set on Coilte forestry as road signage is pretty scarce a lot of the time. I also remember when I was new to field archery that I couldn't 'just' look-up details about the club/venue as their information wasn't persistent on the associations' website at the time. The third thing is as we are a small community we often comment it would be nice to be able to post 'shoot reviews' to share with the host club, archers in the same target group and the wider community... if only we had such a facility?

With FAF, the objective is to help existing and new archers find field archery venues, clubs and their ranges, and be able to submit reviews about the club/an event they attend. Share the experience and grow the sport...

Having these facilities on one site would be terribly handy and would have a broad appeal to all involved in the sport.


## List of user features (excluding user registration and authentication) . . . . 
 
 + Feature to review an event through comment title and link (URL) data entry
 + Feature to comment on existing reviews posted through comment feedback and reviewers name data entry
 + Feature to upvote both the main reviews and the comments associated with those reviews. 
 + Feature to contact site administrator to request venue be added (embedded email link)
 
 Functionality under construction:
 + List of archery venues which can be filtered (json file data)
 + Drill-down capability to access further information about each venue e.g. range-type, images and blub representing the club, directions and on-site facilities (also stored on json file)

## Installation requirements.
 + ReactJS v15.3.0
 + Bootstrap 3
 + create-react-app tool
 + react-router
 + webpack
 + css loader
 + superagent 

 For functionality under construction:
 Firebase (log-in validation)

In order to view the app after cloning it from the repository, a viewer must
 + Open a command window in the repositiory folder (hold Shift Key & right-clcik the mouse)
 + type npm install 
 + type npm start
 + in browser view localhost://3000

## Data Model Design.

ReviewApp 
Sample of the data on that page (API):
    posts = [
     {  id: 1 ,
        title : 'IFAF is great for Field Archery in Ireland',
        link : 'http://ifaf.ie/wordpress/',
        forename : 'Marion',
        surname : 'Hood',
        association : 'IFAF',
        comments : [],
        upvotes : 10
      },

VENUE APP COMPONENTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION:
venue overview "clubs.json":
[ 
    {
        "age": 1, 
        "id": "Wexford",
        "upvotes": 5,

venue detail json (e.g. ashgrove.json):

        "img/phones/Ashgrove.jpg" 
    ] 
}	  
	  

## App Component Design.

## UI Design.
The images show the Home (Landing.js) page in collapsed form and full-page format.

On this page there is the Main, NavBar, Carousel, high-level blurb on field archery and Footer.

## Routing.
. . . . List each route supported and state the associated view . . . . . 

+ /root for app (IndexRoute = Landing.js)
+ /about - descriptive text about the app
+ /venues - will show list of venues (React component under construction, static page currently)
+ /reviews - comments with link and upvotes (API)
+ /reviews/:postid - allows reviewer to comment, leave name & upvote an existing review (local storage)
+ /register - will allow a reviewer to register (under construction)

Additional planned routing:
+ /venues/:clubid - will show specific detail about the club (under construction with parent component 'venues')


## Extra features

. . . . . Briefly explain any non-standard features, functional or non-functional (e.g. user registration, authentication) developed for the app . . . . . .  

None so far. 
+ 'registerApp' not built. 
+ 'club detail' under construction. One feature will be Google maps, using Google API Key, in this component.


## Independent learning.

. . . . . State the non-standard aspects of Angular (or other related technologies) that you researched and applied in this assignment . . . . .  
This semester and this assignment has been a phenominal learning curve for me. In spite of working in IT I have no coding background at all.

For this assignment I have religed heavily on a brilliant react tutorial on YouTube:
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started

I also found this site very good for very simple breakdown of principles of a SPA
https://www.kirupa.com/react/creating_single_page_app_react_using_react_router.htm

To help with building the FAF app I have used:

+ https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials
+ https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-3-react/
+ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41515468/custom-stylesheet-in-react-app (install css loader (npm install --save css-loader )

Additional learning has been through the following:
